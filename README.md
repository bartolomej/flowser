```bash
flow flowser
```

## Key Features

- **Easy to use**: Simplifies your development workflow
- **Transparent development**: See the whole state of your local Flow blockchain in real-time
- **Snapshot management**: Create and checkout [blockchain state snapshots](https://github.com/onflow/flow-emulator#managing-emulator-state) - similar to how Git works
- **Development wallet**: Built in [fcl-dev-wallet](https://github.com/onflow/fcl-dev-wallet) integration for easy blockchain interactions
