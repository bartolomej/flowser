> **News:** We are currently developing Flowser desktop app, as part of the [Flow developer grant #27](https://github.com/onflow/developer-grants/issues/27). Follow us on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/onflowser) or join our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/2Nx3s8yD) for more updates.


Flowser is a convenient development tool for [Flow blockchain](https://www.onflow.org/). It does all the heavy work of managing the Flow emulator, inspecting the current blockchain state and interacting with the network for you!

You can find more information on our documentation website: [docs.flowser.dev](https://docs.flowser.dev).

For a quick walk-through of the tool itself, see [FlipFest video demo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yMs5awvGnlY&t=417s) or our demo from [Flow Office Hours](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LSHwwX4yZJI&t=1496s).

If you encounter any issues during app build or container start, check out our [Troubleshooting Guide](https://docs.flowser.dev/resources/development/#troubleshooting).

### 4. Open in browser

After flowser had successfully started, you can open the app in your favourite browser at [http://localhost:6060](http://localhost:6060) ü•≥.
